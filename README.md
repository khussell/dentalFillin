# dentalFillin

## What? 

Dental Fillin' is an app to connect dental offices with substitute dental hygienists while their permanent dental hygienists are sick or on vacation.

## Why?

This is important because if a hygienist is not available for a day, the doctor loses the hygienist's production for that day.

## How?

This app was made with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, Vanilla JavaScript, Google Maps and Geocode API's, Flatpickr calendar API, Nodemailer, and Passport Authentication.

## Where?
